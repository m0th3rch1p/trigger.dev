import RealtimeExamplesCards from "/snippets/realtime-examples-cards.mdx";

Trigger.dev Realtime allows you subscribe to runs and get real-time updates as they execute. This is useful for monitoring runs, updating UIs, and building real-time dashboards.

## What you can subscribe to

You can subscribe to real-time updates for:

- **Specific runs** - Monitor individual run progress
- **Runs with specific tags** - Track runs by category or user
- **Task runs** - All runs for specific tasks
- **Batch runs** - All runs in a batch

You automatically receive the complete [run object](/realtime/run-object) containing status, timestamps, metadata, tags, and more whenever:

- Run status changes (queued → executing → completed, etc.)
- [Run metadata](/runs/metadata) is updated
- [Run tags](/tags) are added or removed
- [Stream data](/realtime/backend#streams) is emitted

Your tasks can also send additional custom data:

- **Metadata updates** - Update custom metadata on runs that gets streamed to subscribers ([backend](/realtime/backend/metadata) | [React hooks](/realtime/react-hooks/metadata))
- **Stream function** - Stream data chunks in real-time, perfect for AI/LLM streaming ([backend](/realtime/backend/streams) | [React hooks](/realtime/react-hooks/streams))

## Authentication

All Realtime subscriptions require authentication. See our [authentication guide](/realtime/auth) for details on:

- Creating Public Access Tokens for frontend use
- Scoping tokens to specific runs, tasks, tags, or batches
- Auto-generated tokens from `tasks.trigger()`

## Implementation approaches

### Backend subscriptions

Use our server-side SDK to subscribe to runs from your backend code, other tasks, or serverless functions. Perfect for triggering workflows, sending notifications, or updating databases based on run status changes.

→ **[See Backend functions guide](/realtime/backend)**

### Frontend subscriptions

Use our React hooks to build real-time UIs that update as runs execute. Ideal for progress bars, status indicators, and live dashboards.

→ **[See React hooks guide](/realtime/react-hooks)**
