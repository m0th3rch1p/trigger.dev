# Trigger.dev CLI

A CLI that allows you to create, run locally and deploy Trigger.dev background tasks.

Note: this only works with Trigger.dev v3 projects and later. For older projects use the [@trigger.dev/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trigger.dev/cli) package.

## About Trigger.dev

Trigger.dev is an open source platform for building and deploying fully-managed AI agents and workflows. Write workflows in normal async TypeScript for everything from simple tasks to long-running AI agents, heavy media processing, complex real-time systems and more. Complete with trace visibility, managed queues, and elastic infrastructure which handles the horizontal scaling.
