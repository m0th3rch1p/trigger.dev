## About Trigger.dev

Trigger.dev is the open-source platform for building AI workflows in TypeScript. Long-running tasks with retries, queues, observability, and elastic scaling.

### Key features:

- **[Perfect for building AI agents](https://trigger.dev/product/ai-agents)** - Build AI agents using all the services and LLMs you already use, like the AI SDK, OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, etc.
- **[Write tasks in regular code](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/introduction)** - Build background tasks using familiar programming models in native Javascript / Typescript and Python
- **[Long-running tasks](https://trigger.dev/product)** - Handle resource-heavy tasks without timeouts
- **[Durable cron schedules](https://trigger.dev/product/scheduled-tasks)** - Create and attach recurring schedules of up to a year, which never hit a function timeout
- **[Trigger.dev Realtime](https://trigger.dev/product/realtime)** - Real-time bridge between your background tasks and frontend applications with streaming support
- **[React hooks](https://trigger.dev/docs/frontend/react-hooks#react-hooks)** - Interact with the Trigger.dev API using our React hooks package
- **[Max duration](https://trigger.dev/docs/runs/max-duration#max-duration)** - Set maximum execution time for tasks to prevent runaway processes
- **[Batch triggering](https://trigger.dev/docs/triggering#tasks-batchtrigger)** - Use batchTrigger() to initiate multiple runs of a task with custom payloads and options
- **[Structured inputs / outputs](https://trigger.dev/docs/tasks/schemaTask#schematask)** - Define precise data schemas for your tasks with runtime payload validation using SchemaTask
- **[Waits](https://trigger.dev/docs/wait)** - Add waits to your tasks to pause execution for a specified duration
- **[Preview branches](https://trigger.dev/docs/deployment/preview-branches)** - Create isolated environments for testing and development. Integrates with Vercel and git workflows
- **[Waitpoints](https://trigger.dev/docs/upgrade-to-v4#wait-tokens)** - Add human judgment at critical decision points without disrupting workflow
- **[Concurrency & queues](https://trigger.dev/product/concurrency-and-queues)** - Set concurrency rules to manage how multiple tasks execute
- **[Multiple environments](https://trigger.dev/docs/how-it-works#dev-mode)** - Support for DEV, PREVIEW, STAGING, and PROD environments
- **[No infrastructure to manage](https://trigger.dev/docs/how-it-works#trigger-dev-architecture)** - Auto-scaling infrastructure that eliminates timeouts and server management
- **[Automatic retries](https://trigger.dev/docs/errors-retrying)** - If your task encounters an uncaught error, we automatically attempt to run it again
- **[Build extensions](https://trigger.dev/docs/config/extensions/overview#build-extensions)** - Hook directly into the build system and customize the build process
- **[Checkpointing](https://trigger.dev/docs/how-it-works#the-checkpoint-resume-system)** - Tasks are inherently durable, thanks to our checkpointing feature
- **[Versioning](https://trigger.dev/docs/versioning)** - Atomic versioning allows you to deploy new versions without affecting running tasks
- **[Machines](https://trigger.dev/docs/machines)** - Configure the number of vCPUs and GBs of RAM you want the task to use
- **[Observability & monitoring](https://trigger.dev/product/observability-and-monitoring)** - Monitor every aspect of your tasks' performance with comprehensive logging and visualization tools
- **[Logging & tracing](https://trigger.dev/docs/logging)** - Comprehensive logging and tracing for all your tasks
- **[Tags](https://trigger.dev/docs/tags#tags)** - Attach up to five tags to each run as powerful identifiers
- **[Advanced run filters](/product/observability-and-monitoring#advanced-filters)** - Easily sort and find tasks based on status, environment, tags, and creation date
- **[Run metadata](https://trigger.dev/docs/runs/metadata#run-metadata)** - Attach metadata to runs which updates as the run progresses
- **[Bulk actions](https://trigger.dev/docs/bulk-actions)** - Perform actions on multiple runs simultaneously, including replaying and cancelling
- **[Real-time alerts](https://trigger.dev/product/observability-and-monitoring#alerts)** - Choose your preferred notification method for run failures and deployments

## In your codebase

Create tasks where they belong: in your codebase. Version control, localhost, test and review like you're already used to.

```ts
import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

//1. You need to export each task
export const helloWorld = task({
  //2. Use a unique id for each task
  id: "hello-world",
  //3. The run function is the main function of the task
  run: async (payload: { message: string }) => {
    //4. You can write code that runs for a long time here, there are no timeouts
    console.log(payload.message);
  },
});
```

## Deployment

Use our SDK to write tasks in your codebase. There's no infrastructure to manage, your tasks automatically scale and connect to our cloud. Or you can always self-host.

## Environments

We support `Development`, `Staging`, `Preview`, and `Production` environments, allowing you to test your tasks before deploying them to production.

## Full visibility of every job run

View every task in every run so you can tell exactly what happened. We provide a full trace view of every task run so you can see what happened at every step.
