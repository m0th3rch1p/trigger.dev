## About Trigger.dev

Trigger.dev is the open-source platform for building AI workflows in TypeScript. Long-running tasks with retries, queues, observability, and elastic scaling.

### Key features:

- JavaScript and TypeScript SDK
- Long-running tasks with retries, queues, observability, and elastic scaling
- Retries (with exponential backoff)
- Queues and concurrency controls
- Schedules and crons
- Full Observability; logs, live trace views, advanced filtering
- React hooks to interact with the Trigger API from your React app
- Pipe LLM streams straight to your users through the Realtime API
- Trigger tasks and display the run status and metadata anywhere in your app
- Custom alerts, get notified by email, Slack or webhooks
- No infrastructure to manage
- Elastic (scaling)
- Works with your existing tech stack

## In your codebase

Create tasks where they belong: in your codebase. Version control, localhost, test and review like you're already used to.

```ts
import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

//1. You need to export each task
export const helloWorld = task({
  //2. Use a unique id for each task
  id: "hello-world",
  //3. The run function is the main function of the task
  run: async (payload: { message: string }) => {
    //4. You can write code that runs for a long time here, there are no timeouts
    console.log(payload.message);
  },
});
```

## Deployment

Use our SDK to write tasks in your codebase. There's no infrastructure to manage, your tasks automatically scale and connect to our cloud. Or you can always self-host.

## Environments

We support `Development`, `Staging`, `Preview`, and `Production` environments, allowing you to test your tasks before deploying them to production.

## Full visibility of every job run

View every task in every run so you can tell exactly what happened. We provide a full trace view of every task run so you can see what happened at every step.
